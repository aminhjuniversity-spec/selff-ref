MMed-LLM Based Refiner for ExpLICD Self-Refine (Path D)
Uses MMed-Llama-3-8B instead of GPT-4o (FREE - runs on cluster)

ENHANCED VERSION with:
- Improved prompts with clinical examples
- Better output cleaning
- Concept extraction/salvaging
- Targeted refinement (only fix violated concepts)
- Automatic fallback to rule-based when LLM fails
